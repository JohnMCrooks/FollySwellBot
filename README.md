# FollySwellBot
This is a Twitter bot designed to broadcast the Surf report for Folly Beach SC. It is currently a work in progress.

Still to be implemented:
1 - Screenshots of the beach from a live cam. 
2 - Variation in messages based on surf height (e.g. "Grab your board, IT'S DOUBLE OVERHEAD!" versus)
3 - Auto-Follow followers

It Uses the MagicSeaWeed API, Twitter4j, OkHttp, and Jackson.
